This is the [AI link](https://github.com/Yonom/assistant-ui) to the starter project.

## Overview
This is a ChatGPT-style AI assistant built using the Gemini API. Users can ask natural language questions, and the AI responds with intelligent, context-aware answers.  The goal of this project was to get familiar with how API requests are fetched and handled within a Next.js application hence building conversational AI apps and featuring a clean interface and easy-to-extend architecture. Whether you're experimenting with AI interactions or looking to integrate Gemini into your own applications, this project offers a solid foundation to get started quickly.

## How to use

First, add your OpenAI API key to `.env.local` file:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
